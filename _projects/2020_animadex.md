title: AnimaDex
subtitle: Pokédex - but for the real world animals. 
---
This prototype mobile application was designed to make animal learning more engaging for children through augmented reality. Using the phone’s camera, kids could scan real-world animals and instantly see a 3D model appear in their environment, along with key details about the animal. The concept was inspired by the idea of a Pokédex, but instead of fictional creatures, it brought real animals to life, blending play, exploration, and education into one interactive experience. 

This was a project I worked on outside my classwork during my undergraduate degree, built using the Unity platform and Android SDK.
